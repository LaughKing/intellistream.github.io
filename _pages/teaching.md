## Teaching

### Edinburgh University, School of Chemistry

In the School of Chemistry at Edinburgh University I currently teach on two modules:

* Chemical Thermodynamics as part of [Chemistry 1A](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/21-22/dpt/cxchem08016.htm)  (since 2021)
* [Data-Driven Chemistry](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/21-22/dpt/cxchem08031.htm) (since 2020)

Watch this space for material for the above two courses. 


### SUPA
As part of the Scottish Universities Physics Alliance [(SUPA)](https://www.supa.ac.uk), I have been giving an introductory course on molecular mechanics. The lectures slides can be found here:

* [2018 -- SUPA Slides]({{ site.url }}/downloads/SUPA_18.pdf)
* [2019 -- SUPA Slides]()

### CCPBioSim Workshops
[CCPBioSim](http://www.ccpbiosim.ac.uk) is a molecular modelling consortium in the UK that among other things also provides training for PhD students in molecular modelling. 

#### 2022
In 2022 I co-designed and taught on a 2-day [MGMS](https://www.mgms.org/WordPress/) sponsored workshop on [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org) and an introduction to Machine Learning that was hosted at the University of Edinburgh directly after the [8th Annual CCPBioSim Conference](https://www.ccpbiosim.ac.uk/events/past-conferences/eventdetail/138/-/8th-annual-ccpbiosim-conference-frontiers-in-biomolecular-simulation-2022) 

Lecture slides are available here:

* [Clustering](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/WorkshopMDMLEdinburgh2022/blob/main/ML/ML_clustering_01_slides.pdf)
* [Dimensionality Reduction](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/WorkshopMDMLEdinburgh2022/blob/main/ML/ML_DR_02_slides.pdf)
* [Random Forests](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/WorkshopMDMLEdinburgh2022/blob/main/ML/ML_RF_03.pdf)
* [Neural Networks](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/WorkshopMDMLEdinburgh2022/blob/main/ML/ML_NN_04.pdf)


The practical workshop material can be found on GitHub:
* [Clustering](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/WorkshopMDMLEdinburgh2022/blob/main/ML/ML_clustering_01.ipynb)
* [Dimensionality Reduction](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/WorkshopMDMLEdinburgh2022/blob/main/ML/ML_DR_02.ipynb)
* [Random Forests](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/WorkshopMDMLEdinburgh2022/blob/main/ML/ML_RF_03.ipynb)
* [Neural Networks](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/WorkshopMDMLEdinburgh2022/blob/main/ML/ML_NN_04.ipynb)

#### 2019
In 2019 I ran an introductory workshop on alchemical free energy calculations using BioSimSpace and Markov Modelling with pyEmmma.

Slides are available here:   
 
* [Alchemical free energy Introduction]({{ site.url }}/downloads/CCPBioSim-FEP-tutorial.pdf)   
* [Markov State Modelling]({{ site.url }}/downloads/CCPBioSim-MSM-tutorial.pdf)

The practical workshop material can be found on GitHub:

* [Alchemical free energy workshop](https://github.com/CCPBioSim/BSS-alchemistry-workshop)
* [Markov State Modelling workshop](https://github.com/CCPBioSim/msm-workshop)


### Software Carpentries
If you are interested in getting started with Python, Bash, and git, checkout the Software Carpentries resource. Here is a list of Carpentries events I organised in Edinburgh:

* [UK Acoustics Network -- Mar 2021](https://softwaresaved.github.io/2021-03-01-ssi-online/)
* [Data Carpentry -- Apr 2020](https://edcarp.github.io/2020-04-16-sfc-online/)
* [Software Carpentry -- Jan 2020](https://edcarp.github.io/2020-01-29-edinburgh-geo-swc/)
* [Python for Chemists -- Sep 2019](https://edcarp.github.io/2019-09-26-edinburgh-swc/)
* [Sofware Carpentry -- Sep 2019](https://edcarp.github.io/2019-09-04-edinburgh-swc/)

## Tutorials and Best Practices
### Introduction to best practices in molecular simulations
Getting started with molecular simulations can be difficult, these best practices are a good starting point:

* [Molecular simulations](https://www.livecomsjournal.org/article/5957-best-practices-for-foundations-in-molecular-simulations-article-v1-0)
* [Alchemical free energy simulations](https://github.com/michellab/alchemical-best-practices)

### Markov State Models
If you want to learn more about Markov State models the pyEmma tutorial are a good starting point:

* [Tutorial notebooks](https://github.com/markovmodel/pyemma_tutorials)
* [Tutorial paper](https://www.livecomsjournal.org/article/5965-introduction-to-markov-state-modeling-with-the-pyemma-software-article-v1-0)
