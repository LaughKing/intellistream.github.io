### Software
In general all our code can be found on [github](https://github.com/intellistream/), so feel free to have a look at what is going on at the moment. All feedback is always welcome. 

<b>MorphStream</b> - [MorphStream](https://github.com/intellistream/MorphStream) aims at building a scalable transactional stream processing engine on modern hardware. It allows ACID transactions to be run directly on streaming data. It shares similar project vision with Flink StreamingLedger from Data Artisans , but MorphStream emphsizes more on improving system performance leveraging modern multicore processors. 

> MorphStream is built based on our previous work of Briskstream (SIGMOD'19) and TStream (ICDE'20) but with significant changes: the codebase are exclusive. The code is still under active development and more features will be introduced.

<b>AllianceDB</b> - AllianceDB is an open-source benchmark suite for evaluating and improving stream operation algorithms on modern hardwares.
It is also an open source tool and all code is available on [github](https://github.com/intellistream/AllianceDB). 

<b>Sesame</b> - Sesame aims at building a scalable stream mining library on modern hardware.
It is also an open source tool and all code is available on [github](https://github.com/intellistream/sesame). 

### Hardware
Our team manages dozens of CPU and GPU servers. To access, you must be within the SUTD network. For details, please refer to this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RJfLIpZfG87YV8f3nkSh1OZ091oIQVM-/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102789742341353270250&rtpof=true&sd=true).
