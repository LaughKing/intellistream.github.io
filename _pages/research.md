### Research
***Stream Processing*** with **Database Management** • **Networking Systems** • **Machine Learning** • **Data Mining** 

From a high-level point of view, our research goal is to optimize and utilize distributed and parallel stream processing technology to better support existing and emerging big data applications. This is important to improve performance and reduce resource consumption, especially for the network connected world
by 5G, IoT, etc. The group has the following current research interests:

- Hardware-conscious stream processing algorithms
- Novel stream data management solutions
- Online machine learning and data stream mining algorithms
- Novel streaming approaches for network function virtualization and software-defined networks

### Software

- [MorphStream](https://github.com/intellistream/MorphStream) aims at building a scalable transactional stream processing engine on modern hardware. It allows ACID transactions to be run directly on streaming data. It shares similar project vision with Flink StreamingLedger from Data Artisans , but MorphStream emphsizes more on improving system performance leveraging modern multicore processors. 

- MorphStream is built based on our previous work of Briskstream (SIGMOD'19) and TStream (ICDE'20) but with significant changes: the codebase are exclusive. The code is still under active development and more features will be introduced.

- AllianceDB is an open-source benchmark suite for evaluating and improving stream operation algorithms on modern hardwares.
It is also an open source tools and all code is available on [github](https://github.com/intellistream/AllianceDB).

In general all our code can be found on [github](https://github.com/intellistream/), so feel free to have a look at what is going on at the moment. All feedback is always welcome.
