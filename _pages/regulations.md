# How Our Lab Works

<details>
<summary><strong>Goals and Expectations</strong></summary>
<p>

### What We Strive to Achieve:

- Dive deeply into the latest research trends and methodologies to stay at the forefront of our field.
- Build a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects relevant to our research.
- Aim to pass the Qualifying Exam showcasing significant progress.
- Develop and present a compelling thesis that effectively communicates your major discoveries.

### Research Quality and Integrity:

- We prioritize the quality of research over the quantity of publications. Exceptional researchers may have fewer publications, focusing instead on depth and significance.
- I will provide thorough support throughout your journey, from developing ideas to sharing your findings, while upholding the highest standards of academic integrity.
- Progression through milestones like the Qualifying Exam and thesis defense will reflect your true capabilities and readiness.

### Support Available:

- Expect weekly 30-minute one-on-one meetings for detailed discussions and personalized support.
- These sessions are collaborative; think of me more as a senior colleague than a supervisor.
- Access expert networks for collaboration and advice, especially when facing challenges outside my direct expertise.
- Receive guidance on publication and presentation opportunities to boost your visibility and impact.
