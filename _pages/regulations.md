# How our lab works

## Goals and Expectations

### Goals You Should Strive to Achieve:

- Engage deeply with current research trends and methodologies to ensure cutting-edge knowledge and application in our field.
- Develop robust proficiency in both the theoretical and practical aspects of our research area.
- Successfully pass the Qualifying Exam, demonstrating significant research progress.
- Craft a convincing thesis that effectively communicates your key findings to the examination panel.

### Research Contributions and Academic Integrity:

- Our primary focus is on the quality of research, rather than the quantity of publications. It is recognized that outstanding researchers may graduate without numerous publications, focusing instead on the depth and impact of their work.
- Comprehensive support will be provided throughout your academic journey, from hypothesis formation to result dissemination. Maintaining academic integrity is paramount; I will not engage in any actions that could unfairly influence outcomes such as the Qualifying Exam or thesis defense.
- Advancement through academic milestones will be based solely on your merit and readiness, ensuring a genuine reflection of your competence and understanding.

### Support You Can Expect From Me:

- Weekly half-hour one-on-one meetings dedicated to discussions and support. These sessions are designed for you to seek guidance on your research, address challenges, and explore new ideas.
- View these meetings as collaborative opportunities with a senior researcher, rather than mere directives from a supervisor. My role is to support and facilitate your development as a researcher.
- Access to a network of industry and academic professionals for collaboration and advice, particularly when your research challenges extend beyond my expertise. I will help facilitate introductions and collaborations with specialists to provide the necessary support for overcoming these challenges.
- Guidance on opportunities for research publication and presentation to enhance your professional growth and visibility in the academic community.

## Details

### Expectations for Writing Research Papers

- For your first research paper, I will guide you closely throughout the drafting process. This mentorship is designed to acquaint you with the structure, style, and intricacies of academic writing specific to our field.
- After your first paper, I expect you to independently draft complete versions of your subsequent papers. This approach is intended to enhance your confidence and proficiency in effectively communicating scientific findings.
- While I seek greater independence from you with each paper, I will continue to offer feedback and support, ensuring your work adheres to the rigorous standards of our research community.

### Working Hours

- Your working hours are flexible, provided you:
  - Meet all project deadlines and sustain productivity.
  - Attend all scheduled meetings, unless prior excuses are made.
  - Keep open communication regarding your schedule and availability.

### Lab Meetings

- We conduct biweekly group seminars, usually on Friday afternoons, where attendance is mandatory for all group members. Each seminar features a presentation by a member on a research paper from a top-tier conference, promoting an in-depth discussion.
- The role of presenter rotates to give everyone the opportunity to lead discussions, enhancing our lab’s collective understanding and critique of cutting-edge research.
- These meetings also serve as a platform for sharing updates on individual projects and for receiving group feedback.

### Opportunities in Grant Proposal Writing

- Occasionally, I may extend invitations to lab members to assist in drafting grant proposals, particularly when the content significantly aligns with their research areas. Participation in this process is entirely voluntary.
- Engaging in grant writing provides invaluable experience in securing funding and grasping the broader impacts of your research. It also influences the direction and scope of our lab’s future endeavors.
- While participation can significantly benefit your research career, the choice to engage in proposal writing remains yours, respecting your existing commitments and research focus.

### Work-Life Balance

- While I often work long hours, I do not expect nor desire everyone in the lab to adopt this style. It is crucial to find a balance that allows you to be productive while maintaining your well-being.
- Engaging in activities like sports is encouraged; if you enjoy swimming, for instance, feel free to invite me along. It’s a great way for us to stay active and break away from the sedentary routine of office work.
- Maintaining a healthy work-life balance is essential, not only for your personal health but also for sustaining long-term productivity and creativity in your research.
- Remember, it's important to step away from work periodically to recharge. This approach helps in maintaining enthusiasm and perspective in your research endeavors.
