# How Our Lab Works

## Goals and Expectations

### What You Shall Strive to Achieve:

- Dive deeply into the latest research trends and methodologies to stay at the forefront of our field.
- Build a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects relevant to our research.
- Aim to pass the Qualifying Exam showcasing significant progress.
- Develop and present a compelling thesis that effectively communicates your major discoveries.

### Research Quality and Integrity:

- We prioritize the quality of research over the quantity of publications. Exceptional researchers may have fewer publications, focusing instead on depth and significance.
- I will provide thorough support throughout your journey, from developing ideas to sharing your findings, while upholding the highest standards of academic integrity.
- Progression through milestones like the Qualifying Exam and thesis defense will reflect your true capabilities and readiness.

### Support Available:

- Expect weekly 30-minute one-on-one meetings for detailed discussions and personalized support. These sessions are collaborative; think of me more as a senior colleague than a supervisor.
- Access expert networks for collaboration and advice, especially when facing challenges outside my direct expertise.
- Receive guidance on publication and presentation opportunities to boost your visibility and impact.

## Detailed Protocols

### Writing Research Papers:

- Receive detailed guidance while drafting your first paper to learn the academic writing norms specific to our field.
- For subsequent papers, take the lead in drafting, using the skills you’ve developed to independently articulate your research.
- Continuous feedback will be provided to ensure your work meets our community’s standards.

### Flexible Working Hours:

- Your hours are flexible, with the expectation that you:
  - Meet all deadlines and remain productive.
  - Attend all required meetings unless excused.
  - Communicate openly about your schedule and availability.

### Regular Lab Meetings:

- Attend mandatory biweekly seminars on Friday afternoons, where each member presents research from top-tier conferences.
- Presenters rotate, ensuring everyone gains experience in leading scholarly discussions.
- Use these sessions to update the group on your projects and gather feedback.

### Grant Proposal Opportunities:

- You may be invited to help draft grant proposals if the topics align closely with your research. This is voluntary.
- Such involvement can significantly enhance your understanding of funding mechanisms and the broader research impact.
- The decision to participate will always respect your current commitments and research focus.
