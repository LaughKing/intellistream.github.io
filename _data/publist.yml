- title: "MorphStream: Adaptive Scheduling for Scalable Transactional Stream Processing on Multicores"
  image: morphstream.png
  description: |
    Transactional stream processing engines (TSPEs) differ significantly in their designs, but all rely on nonadaptive scheduling strategies for processing concurrent state transactions. Subsequently, none exploit multicore parallelism to its full potential due to complex workload dependencies. In this talk, I will describe MorphStream, which adopts a novel approach by decomposing scheduling strategies into three dimensions and then strives to make the right decision along each dimension, based on analyzing the decision trade-offs under varying workload characteristics. Compared to the state-of-the-art, MorphStream achieves up to 3.4 times higher throughput and 69.1% lower processing latency for handling real-world use cases with complex and dynamically changing workload dependencies. MorphStream represents a series of works in my team, which have been published in ICDE’20, SIGMOD’23, VLDB Journal’23, ICDE’24, ICDE’24 (Demo) in the past.

  description: |
    The intra-window join (IaWJ), i.e., joining two input streams over a single window, is a core operation in modern stream processing applications. This paper presents the frst comprehensive study on parallelizing the IaWJ on modern multicore architectures. Our multiple follow-up works have been published in ICDE 2024, SIGMOD 2024, and SIGMOD 2025.

  image: SentiStream.png
  description: |
    Online sentiment analysis has emerged as a crucial component in numerous data-driven applications, including social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and online reputation management. Despite their importance, current methodologies falter in effectively managing the continuously evolving nature of data streams, largely due to their reliance on substantial, pre-existing labelled datasets. This paper presents sentistream, a novel co-training framework specifically designed for efficient sentiment analysis within dynamic data streams. Comprising unsupervised, semi-supervised, and stream merge modules, sentistream guarantees constant adaptability to evolving data landscapes. This research delves into the continuous adaptation of language models for online sentiment analysis, focusing on real-world applications. Experimental evaluations using data streams derived from three benchmark sentiment analysis datasets confirm that our proposed methodology surpasses existing approaches in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.

- title: "Data Stream Clustering: An In-depth Empirical Study"
  image: sesame.png
  description: |
    Data Stream Clustering (DSC) plays an important role in mining continuous and unlabeled data streams in real-world applications. Over the last decades, numerous DSC algorithms have been proposed with promising clustering accuracy and efficiency. Despite the significant differences among existing DSC algorithms, they are commonly built around four key design aspects: summarizing data structure, window model, outlier detection mechanism, and offline refinement strategy. However, there is a lack of empirical studies on these key design aspects in the same codebase using real-world workloads with distinct characteristics. As a result, it is difficult for researchers to improve upon the state-of-the-art. In this paper, we conduct such a study of DSC on its four key design aspects. We implemented state-of-the-art variants of all of these design choices in an open-sourced platform from scratch and evaluated them using both real-world and synthetic workloads. Our analysis identifies the fundamental issues and trade-offs of each design choice in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. We even find that combining flexible design choices led to the development of a new algorithm called Benne, which can be tuned to achieve either better accuracy or better efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art.

- title: "PECJ: Stream Window Join on Disorder Data Streams with Proactive Error Compensation"
  image: pecj.png
  description: Stream Window Join (SWJ), a vital operation in stream analytics, struggles with achieving a balance between accuracy and latency due to out-of-order data arrivals. Existing methods predominantly rely on adaptive buffering, but often fall short in performance, thereby constraining practical applications. We introduce PECJ, a solution that proactively incorporates unobserved data to enhance accuracy while reducing latency, thus requiring robust predictive modeling of stream oscillation. At the heart of PECJ lies a mathematical formulation of the posterior distribution approximation (PDA) problem using variational inference (VI). This approach circumvents error propagation while meeting the low-latency demands of SWJ. We detail the implementation of PECJ, striking a balance between complexity and generality, and discuss both analytical and learning-based approaches. Experimental evaluations reveal PECJ's superior performance. The successful integration of PECJ into a multi-threaded SWJ benchmark testbed further establishes its practical value, demonstrating promising advancements in enhancing data stream processing capabilities amidst out-of-order data.
