- title: "Data Stream Clustering: An In-depth Empirical Study"
  image: sesame.png
  description: We conduct a study of data stream clustering algorithm on its four key design aspects. We implemented state-of-the-art variants of all of these design choices in an open-sourced platform from scratch and evaluated them using both real-world and synthetic workloads. Our analysis identifies the fundamental issues and trade-offs of each design choice in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

In this paper, we revisit three common design aspects (i.e., pipelined processing with message passing, on-demand data parallelism, and JVM based implementation) of DSPSs on a modern scale-up server.
