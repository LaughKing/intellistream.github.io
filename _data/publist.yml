  description: Transactional stream processing (TSP) strives to create a cohesive model that merges the advantages of both transactional and stream-oriented guarantees. This survey intends to introduce TSP and present our perspective on its future progression. Our primary goals are twofold, 1) to provide insights into the diverse TSP requirements and methodologies, and 2) to inspire the design and development of groundbreaking TSP systems.

  description: We conduct a study of data stream clustering algorithm on its four key design aspects. We implemented state-of-the-art variants of all of these design choices in an open-sourced platform from scratch and evaluated them using both real-world and synthetic workloads. Our analysis identifies the fundamental issues and trade-offs of each design choice in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.
