    This project concerning the designing of novel stream processing systems on modern hardware. For example, MorphStream, which adopts a novel approach by decomposing scheduling strategies into three dimensions and then strives to make the right decision along each dimension, based on analyzing the decision trade-offs under varying workload characteristics. Compared to the state-of-the-art, MorphStream achieves up to 3.4 times higher throughput and 69.1% lower processing latency for handling real-world use cases with complex and dynamically changing workload dependencies.

  description: |
    The intra-window join (IaWJ), i.e., joining two input streams over a single window, is a core operation in modern stream processing applications. This paper presents the first comprehensive study on parallelizing the IaWJ on modern multicore architectures. Our follow-up works have been published in ICDE 2024, SIGMOD 2024, and SIGMOD 2025.

    Data Stream Clustering (DSC) plays an important role in mining continuous and unlabeled data streams in real-world applications. Over the last decades, numerous DSC algorithms have been proposed with promising clustering accuracy and efficiency. Our study conducts a thorough empirical evaluation of these algorithms. Our follow up works concerning designing of better DSC algorithm.

  description: |
    Stream Learning (SL) requires models to rapidly adapt to continuous data streams, setting it apart from traditional Continual Learning (CL). Recent SL methods emphasize efficiency by selecting data subsets for training, but they often struggle due to their reliance on static, rule-based selection algorithms that cannot effectively adapt to the changing importance of data. We conducted a series of works on SL in this project concerning topics like online sentiment analysis, LLM updates, and so on.

  description: |
    Data stream compression attracts much attention recently due to the rise of IoT applications. Thanks to the balanced computational power and energy consumption, asymmetric multicores are widely used in IoT devices. This paper introduces CStream, a novel framework for parallelizing stream compression on asymmetric multicores to minimize energy consumption without violating the user-specified compressing latency constraint. Existing works cannot effectively utilize asymmetric multicores for stream compression, primarily due to the non-trivial asymmetric computation and asymmetric communication effects. To this end, CStream is developed with the following two novel designs: 1) fine-grained decomposition, which decomposes a stream compression procedure into multiple finegrained tasks to better expose the task-core affinities under the asymmetric computation effects; and 2) asymmetry-aware task scheduling, which schedules the decomposed tasks based on a novel cost model to exploit the exposed task-core affinities while considering asymmetric communication effects. To validate our proposal, we evaluate CStream with five competing mechanisms of parallelizing stream compression algorithms on a recent asymmetric multicore processor. Our extensive experiments based on a benchmark consisting of three algorithms and four datasets show that CStream outperforms alternative approaches by up to 53% lower energy consumption without compressing latency constraint violation.
