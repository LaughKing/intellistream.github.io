  description: |
    Transactional stream processing engines (TSPEs) differ significantly in their designs, but all rely on nonadaptive scheduling strategies for processing concurrent state transactions. Subsequently, none exploit multicore parallelism to its full potential due to complex workload dependencies. In this talk, I will describe MorphStream, which adopts a novel approach by decomposing scheduling strategies into three dimensions and then strives to make the right decision along each dimension, based on analyzing the decision trade-offs under varying workload characteristics. Compared to the state-of-the-art, MorphStream achieves up to 3.4 times higher throughput and 69.1% lower processing latency for handling real-world use cases with complex and dynamically changing workload dependencies. MorphStream represents a series of works in my team, which have been published in ICDE’20, SIGMOD’23, VLDB Journal’23, ICDE’24, ICDE’24 (Demo) in the past.

  image: intraJoinStudy.png
  description: |
    The intra-window join (IaWJ), i.e., joining two input streams over a single window, is a core operation in modern stream processing applications. This paper presents the first comprehensive study on parallelizing the IaWJ on modern multicore architectures. Our follow-up works have been published in ICDE 2024, SIGMOD 2024, and SIGMOD 2025.

  description: |
    Online sentiment analysis has emerged as a crucial component in numerous data-driven applications, including social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and online reputation management. Despite their importance, current methodologies falter in effectively managing the continuously evolving nature of data streams, largely due to their reliance on substantial, pre-existing labelled datasets. This paper presents SentiStream, a novel co-training framework specifically designed for efficient sentiment analysis within dynamic data streams. Comprising unsupervised, semi-supervised, and stream merge modules, SentiStream guarantees constant adaptability to evolving data landscapes. This research delves into the continuous adaptation of language models for online sentiment analysis, focusing on real-world applications. Experimental evaluations using data streams derived from three benchmark sentiment analysis datasets confirm that our proposed methodology surpasses existing approaches in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.
